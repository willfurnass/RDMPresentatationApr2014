# Research Data Management and Open Research

Presentation on Research Data Management given to the [Pennine Water Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/penninewatergroup), University of Sheffield, in Apr 2014.

The presentation's slides can be found in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.  The content is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which is interpretted by [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) to create an interactive HTML slideshow.  

If you want to view/present the slides whilst offline, you can display the slides in `index.html` using a simple webserver such as that which comes with Python:

```bash
    python3 -m http.server
```

When this web server starts, it will tell you which local port to point your web browser at.
